   5. Logout and try accessing /dashboard - should redirect to /login
   ```

### Test Core Features

3. **Test Property Management**:

   ```
   1. Dashboard -> Properties -> Add New Property
   2. Fill in Maryland address with county selection
   3. Note: Processing fee auto-calculates based on county

   2. Select property (auto-populates county pricing)
   3. Select tenant for that property
   4. Fill in rent owed amounts
   5. Note: Processing fee suggests county-specific amount
   6. Save and verify case appears with proper status badges
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

- **profiles**: User accounts with role-based access
- **properties**: Property information with Maryland county support
- **tenants**: Tenant management with property relationships
- **legal_cases**: FTPR case tracking with financial details

### Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Middleware-based authentication checks
- Role-based access control
- Secure session management

### State Management

- Zustand stores for auth and app state
- Real-time state updates
- Optimistic UI updates

## 🔮 Next Steps (Remaining TODOs)

### High Priority

- [ ] **Document Generation**: Create Maryland-compliant legal documents with jsPDF
- [ ] **Case Detail Views**: View and edit individual legal cases
- [ ] **Case Workflow**: Status progression (draft → submitted → in progress → complete)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Payment Integration**: Stripe payment processing for county fees
- [ ] **Admin Dashboard**: Reporting and oversight features
- [ ] **Email Notifications**: Case status updates and reminders

### Low Priority

- [ ] **Document Templates**: 30-day notice, court forms, etc.
- [ ] **Audit Logs**: Track case status changes
- [ ] **Bulk Operations**: Multi-case management
